## Things I need to say

This is the outcome from my ansible experience.
Any recommendation here might be subjective and I hope, you don't just follow them, but think, if it really applies to your usecase.
*I might be wrong as some points! Remember this*

My background is PHP/Symfony development, so you will find a lot of references to this.

Also I use ansible a lot for provisioning my desktop pcs and raspberry pies, which is different at some places, when provisioning a cluster for e.g. a web application (wich I also already setup).
I hope, this different types of usage of ansible will support each other and not stand in eithers way.

This is mostly a collection of docs, talks and other notes I created in the last years. So be prepared do read some thing twice or ore often.
(I will clean up, after I collected everything together)

(I'm not a native english writer, so, I you find sections with bad language, create a pull request :P)
